## Endpoints

Note: All values are little endian.

### Host to Device
+ Size: 0x40 (64 bytes)
+ EP addr: 0x01
+ Type: Interrupt

### Device to Host
+ Size: 0x40 (64 bytes)
+ EP addr: 0x81
+ Type: Interrupt


## Data

In both directions the data sent over the HID interface is broken up into repeated chunks of packets which take the following form:

|Bits  | 63 - 32 | 31 | 30 - 0 |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |
|**Field** | Value to be written or Read val  | R = 0, W = 1 | Field ID   |

An invalid packet that should be ignored take this form instead:
|Bits  | 63 - 32 | 31 - 0 |
| --- |--- |--- |
|**Field** | Ignored   | 0xFFFF_FFFF   |


Multiple packets can be included within the 64 byte endpoint and unused packet slots will be marked invalid.

v        v v        v v        v v        v v        v v        v v        v v        v

|Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  | |Packet  |
+--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+
```

## From Host to Device (USB Out)
The hose will create transfers by concatenating one or more of these packets and writing these to the Host to Device endpoint. The device will then respond to the commands by writing responses to the Device to Host endpoint. If a write is issued to the device, the relevant field will be updated whilst a read will initiate the return of the field present value. The device will ignore write commands to any read only Field IDs.

## From Device to Host (USB In)
The device is allowed to send data back to the host at any time regardless of incoming commands and this must be handled by the host. The device will not issue write commands to the host.

### git Commit ID
The value of this response can be treated as integer and formatted into a fixed width 7 character hexadecimal field to represent the short form git commit the firmware was built from.



# Example
1) If the host wanted to move the focusser to position 12000, it would send the following command:
Field ID 0x00000004 with a payload of 12000 (0x2EE0). The complete command would encode as:
```
(12000) << 32 | (1 << 31) | (0x04) ≡ 0x2ee080000004 ≡ [0, 0, 46, 224, 128, 0, 0, 4]
```
2) This is then written to the Host to Device endpoint.
3) The device will start moving to the target.
4) The host is then able to poll the Moving bit (0x01) in [Status Flags](#status-flags) which will clear upon the completion of the move.
