# SympleAstroFocus
A symple AF DIY way to control a stepper motor from a PC for astronomy

The aims of the project is simple setup, DIY hardware creation and use. However it aims to have a very rich feature set that 'just works', including but not limited to:
* Native USB connection (No more messing about with serial COM ports!)
* Sensorless homing/stall detection
* Dynamic current scaling to save power
* Configurability if needed past sensible defaults.
* Designed around common hardware, allowing for easy sourcing of parts for DIY construction using only bread-board-able components.

Still a work in progress - but core functionality is working and tested within NINA using custom PCB on both a moonlite stepper on an RC8 and a generic Nema17 stepper belt driving a Rokinion 135 lens.

Also aiming to have prebuilt modules available for sale in future once supply chain shortages ease.
