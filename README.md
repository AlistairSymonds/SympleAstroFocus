# SympleAstroFocus
A symple AF DIY way to control a stepper motor from a PC for astronomy

The aims of the project is simple setup and hardware creation

Still a work in progress - but core functionality is working and tested within NINA using custom PCB on both a moonlite stepper on an RC8 and a generic Nema17 stepper belt driving a Rokinion 135 lens.

Also aiming to have prebuilt modules available for sale in future once supply chain shortages ease.
